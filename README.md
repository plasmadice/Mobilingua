# Mobilingua - A dual caption tool for language learners

This project was created during NBCUniversal's 2018 Hackathon in Miami. The goal of the project is a chrome extension capable of modifying certain webpages to show the captions of two languages side-by-side. Your favorite language alongside the language you are learning.

## How it Works // Getting Started

To start: Clone this repository and `cd` into the root folder. Either open `index.html` or host the project using a live server.

### TODO & WIP

1. Refactor for use in a chrome extension
2. Implement word dictionary search when video is paused. Either automatically or triggered by a click on a word
3. Refactor to detect number of already available captions and provide interface to choose which languages to use
