WEBVTT

00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.003
We knew we were alive not that we have the opportunity

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:04.004
to win match two

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:04.088
Zero without problem at home

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:08.033
Then we enter the court mentalized that if

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:09.098
well it will not be simple nor impossible

00:00:09.098 --> 00:00:12.052
Then we demanded to the fullest and thanks gave us results

00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:15.047
Happy It's my third final, I won

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:16.014
One lost one

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:18.066
And now there is another one on the way that is another

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.024
Saints

00:00:19.027 --> 00:00:22.000
Even though today we are eliminated, I think we did

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.089
a good paper The

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:26.078
Football is like this sometimes sometimes you want to

00:00:26.078 --> 00:00:27.003
sometimes not

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.062
And today we have to be eliminated

00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:32.006
Look what is done is through time

00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:33.004
Is nothing

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:36.037
More of En day

00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:40.004
This short period is the entire time that

00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:43.008
We have been working demonstrating observing and see the characteristics of

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:45.066
each of the elements and let's see what is the

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:49.001
need that is required for each of the parties

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.076
Then the success you know well

00:00:51.077 --> 00:00:55.014
Well you say of book and then you comment The success

00:00:55.014 --> 00:00:56.006
you have to work

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:58.055
It's not something to improvise it's something that has to

00:00:58.055 --> 00:00:58.099
watch

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:00.046
You have to plan

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:02.053
He has to talk to have conscience

00:01:02.053 --> 00:01:04.085
The players know what is working what

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:08.088
is intended and because we have players of the characteristics

00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:13.006
how can I retain the ball generate superiority in the associative game

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:17.037
In the associative game that does not but when you can

00:01:17.037 --> 00:01:24.002
the moment We do not produce it This is the level of play that we expected
